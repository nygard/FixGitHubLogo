FixGitHubLogo
=============

This is a Safari Extension to fix the context menu on the GitHub logo.

They obnoxiously do some JavaScript stuff to hijack the context menu to show a popup.  Bad GitHub!  Bad Safari for allowing them to do that!

Update (2013-02-14): It looks like they've finally recognized their error and no longer hijack the context menu.
